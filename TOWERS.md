- **Charging animation** with explosive energy buildup
- **Shell loading system** around the base (4 shells visible)
- **Wide barrel opening** for explosive projectiles
- **Brown/orange** color scheme with military appearance

### Strategic Use
- ✅ **Area damage** - damages multiple enemies simultaneously  
- ✅ **Crowd control** - excellent against grouped enemies
- ✅ **Chokepoint domination** - devastating at narrow passages

## 🏆 Advanced Strategies

### **Tower Placement Principles**

1. **Damage Maximization**: Place towers where enemies spend the most time
2. **Range Optimization**: Overlap tower ranges for continuous coverage
3. **Economic Efficiency**: Balance cost vs. effectiveness based on wave difficulty
4. **Utility First**: Slow towers increase everyone else's effectiveness
5. **Chokepoint Control**: Focus firepower at natural bottlenecks

### **Resource Management**

- **Early Investment**: Start with Basic + Slow combinations
- **Mid-Game Scaling**: Upgrade to Heavy/Sniper when affordable  
- **Late Game Power**: Invest in Laser/Splash for crowd control
- **Emergency Funds**: Always keep $100+ for emergency tower placement

### **Visual Indicators Guide**

- **Range Circles**: White gradient circles show tower coverage
- **Muzzle Flashes**: Indicate when towers are actively firing
- **Animation Speed**: Faster animations = higher fire rates
- **Particle Effects**: More particles = more powerful towers
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Gray = Basic utility
  - Red = High damage  
  - Blue = Energy/Technology
  - Brown = Explosive/Area
  - Ice Blue = Crowd Control
