🐛 Tower Defense - Wave Progression Debug
========================================

💾 Backing up original config.json...
📝 Setting up debug configuration...
🎮 Debug Configuration Features:
   • Debug mode enabled (console output)
   • Fast enemy spawning (0.5s delay)
   • Fast enemy movement (2x speed)
   • Powerful towers for quick kills
   • Reduced enemy health for faster testing
   • Only 3 enemies per wave for quick completion

🔍 What to Look For:
==============================
1. Console output showing enemy spawning
2. Wave completion detection messages
3. Level/wave advancement notifications
4. Enemy kill count tracking
5. UI showing wave number progression

🎯 Testing Instructions:
========================
1. Try both Normal Mode and Endless Mode
2. Place a few Basic Towers (Key 1) near the start
3. Watch console output for debug messages
4. Verify waves advance after all enemies are killed
5. Check that wave counter increases in UI

📊 Expected Console Output:
Spawning enemy 1/3 for wave 1
Spawning enemy 2/3 for wave 1
Spawning enemy 3/3 for wave 1
Enemy killed! Remaining: 2
Enemy killed! Remaining: 1
Enemy killed! Remaining: 0
Wave 1 completed! Enemies: 0, Spawned: 3/3

🔄 Restoring original configuration...

🎉 Debug session completed!
If waves still don't progress, check for these issues:
   1. Enemies spawning but not being killed
   2. Wave completion logic not triggering
   3. Level info display blocking progression
   4. Enemy counter mismatch (spawned vs. expected)

Report any console error messages for further debugging.
